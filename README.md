# D0020E-Open-MCT
As studen project at Lulea Tekniska Universitet for D0020E. It uses Open MCT from Nasa to build an MCT(Mission Control Software) to connect to a DBU (Digital Baseband Unit).

## Installation
To building and running D0020E-Open-MCT in you local enviorment you will need Node.js installed.

1. **git clone https://github.com/matnij-4/D0020E-Open-MCT**
2. **cd D0020E-Open-MCT**
3. **npm install**
4. **npm start**

To se up the program for the first time you need to do some more configurations. That is if you want it to look a bit more nice.

1. **Go to my Items folder in the program.**

## Layout

If you wan to creat you own layout for the systems and telemetry data you can. Just adde it with the creat button and put it in my Items. Those settings are only stored in the browser cache.

For longer storage of you setting you can export them as an JSON files and importem at a later date.

## Architecture

A simple version of the architecture for the program can bee senn in the picture below.

Open MCT as you can see have no direct comminucation to the outside. 

## Plugin

### Dictionary
**TO DO**

The dictionary plugin set up the formant for the data that is going to be collected. It dose not get any of the data only set the format.

### Realtime
**TO DO**

It collects the data fromt he JS server and sends it to Open MCT.

### Layout
This plugin handels the subfolders for the subsystems. It dividends the telemetri data into subfolders to make it easier to find the right telemetri. As well it creats premade Status Widgets and adds them to the corresponding subsystem.

### Historical
**TO DO**

## Config file

The config file has a checklist in the project that imports a config file with ips, ids and ports.

When importing a config file the program checks:

- If the keys are the same as in a check file. The check is located in the configloader

- If the key has a attached value

If one of the conditions above are fulfilled the importated data is set to *null*

  

### Realtime server

The realtime sever(rt) is where the data is received in realtime and will be the primary server used during operational use.

  

### Database server

The Database server (db) is responsible for storing data. The database server will be used for retriving old data.

  

### Config fields

- rtIp 
Specifies the ip address for the real-time server. The config file only accepts a IPv4 address.

- rtPort 
Specifies the port of the real-time server.

- rtKey 
Authentication key for establishing a connection to real-time server.

- dbIp
Specifies the IP address for the historical database

- dbPort 
Specifies the port for the historical database

- dbUname
Specifies the username for login into the historical server.

- dbPass 
Specifies the password for the historical database.
